# ADA Project - Exchange Rate Arbitrage Finder 💹

To address the challenge in the ADA course regarding identifying arbitrage opportunities from exchange rates, our team has developed software that runs on MacOS💻.

## Overview ⚙️

The software utilizes the [FreeCurrency API](https://app.freecurrencyapi.com/) to fetch real-time and historical exchange rates. The user interface is crafted using SwiftUI. We incorporated the Bellman-Ford algorithm to meet the specific needs of this software. This algorithm processes the data returned from the API, calculates the results, and ultimately displays them through the user interface.

We also prioritized an intuitive user experience, including animations to facilitate user interaction. Users can easily configure their own API key to access the desired functionality seamlessly.

Feel free to explore and leverage the power of our exchange rate arbitrage finder! 🌐✨
